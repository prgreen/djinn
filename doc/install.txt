For the build to work you need to have in your path:

ragel

lemon

premake4

See dependencies.txt for more details on how to obtain them.


Then you run (for linux and mingw):

premake4 gmake
make                           (or mingw32-make or mingw64-make)


You may also generate visual C++ project files, see premake4 documentation.

make config="release"          (or mingw32-make or mingw64-make)
